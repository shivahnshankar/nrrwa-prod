**Dear Homeowner,**

Namaste and a warm welcome to Roopa Nagar, a verdant, peace-loving haven conceived with vision and mission nurtured with care. We are delighted that you have chosen to build your dream home in this uniquely harmonious community. Founded by the late Shri Suvarna with a deep sense of vision, Roopa Nagar today stands as a testament to thoughtful living, community cooperation and timeless aesthetics.


As you begin or continue your construction journey, we wish to share some community-endorsed practices to help ensure your dream home grows in harmony with its surroundings. Over the years, we have observed that even the most well-intentioned projects can inadvertently disrupt the peace and cleanliness of the neighbourhood if site protocols are not strictly upheld by the engineers/contractors.


While statutory guidelines from MUDA (MDA) and others will guide your compliance, our collective aspiration is to maintain Roopa Nagar's hallmark i.e cleanliness and tranquillity. You, as the owner, are pivotal in instructing your contractors accordingly and responding promptly to any concerns raised.


Namma Roopanagara Residents Welfare Association(NRRWA), a registered body formed with the support from the residents and is keen in engaging with environmental care and having a clean and beautiful Roopanagara.  To support this effort, we have enclosed a document outlining Guidelines for Owners and Instructions to Contractors. These principles reflect the spirit of collective responsibility and are meant to ease your engagement during construction, while strengthening our mutual bonds as residents. We trust you will consider them both reasonable and beneficial.


We, NRRWA team are also there with you for any support, guidance, or assistance at any stage, if required. Please feel free to reach out to us.


Together, let us build not just houses, but lasting relationships—founded on care, respect and shared purpose fulfilling the vision and mission of Roopanagara – a safe, clean and beautiful space for a happy living.

Regards

**Team NRRWA**


## Suggestion to Owners

- Having a house design that leaves adequate open space around the structure as per applicable norms.
- Protecting existing roadside trees, to the extent feasible.
- Planting tree saplings in front of the house wherever possible to enhance greenery.
- Allocating space within your site for a small green belt or lung space.
- Harvesting rooftop rainwater by providing storage tanks or recharge pits.
- Segregating waste at source – using separate bins for wet, dry, and fillable waste.
- Using minimal plastic during housewarming celebrations.
- Cleaning the surroundings after any ceremony or event.

## Recommended Action to be taken by Owners

- Take written consent from neighbours before using adjacent empty plots for storing materials.
- Ensure that no construction material or debris is dumped on public roads or spaces. If dumped, ensure that these are cleared as early as possible 
- Do not block roads by placing watchman huts, storage sheds, or shamiyanas.
- Avoid planting large tree saplings close to neighbouring sites.
- Ensure post-event clean-up after housewarming or similar gatherings.

## Instructions for Contractors

Please pass on these instructions to your contractors.

- Do not store cement, sand, bricks, or stones on public roads.
- Prohibit burning of plastic, construction waste, or vegetation on-site.
- Maintain cleanliness at the construction site and its immediate surroundings.
- Collect all packaging waste (cement bags, plastic, cartons) and clear them periodically in accordance with municipal rules – this is a zero plastic zone.
