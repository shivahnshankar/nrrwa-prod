Improving a green belt developed by  Residents, DHBCS and Dhruv  Compusoft for use of Senior Citizens –Now named as “Namma Vana”

#### Development of Children Play area

Unique facilities provided at the park area for use by public :

- Toddlers Play area
- Open Shuttle court
- Volleyball court
- Area for Traditional plays


### Streetlights

In 2024-25, DHBCS handed over the maintenance of the streetlights over to the Town Panchayat. Unlike in the past where we would call DHBCS and they would handle streetlights, residents now had to go to Town Panchayat office and register a complaint. This was tedious and required repeated follow-ups.

NRRWA, and in particular Secretary Mr. Somayaji, is now co-ordinating with the vendor from Town Panchayat to ensure streetlight problems are addressed quickly. Residents have to register a complaint and NRRWA will co-ordinate with the vendor. This has significantly improved the streetlight situation. 

### Co-ordination with DHBCS and government agencies
