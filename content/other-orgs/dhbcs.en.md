Deepa House Building Co-operative Society (DHBCS) is having history of 42 year.  Started by Sri Suvarna and his team, with a vision of providing house sites with very reasonable price to the needy people, it has completed 4 projects successfully.

Roopanagara is their second project which was developed in 3 stages. Maintenance of Roopanagara is being taken up by the DHBCS since beginning. Now except street light and garbage collection, all other services are maintained by the DHBCS.

NRRWA was formed with the encouragement received from the DHBCS and is
supporting all our development projects both physically, morally and financially.
