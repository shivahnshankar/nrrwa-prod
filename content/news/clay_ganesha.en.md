The Clay Ganesha Workshop, a cherished initiative of our Namma Roopanagara Residents Welfare Association (NRRWA), was first launched in 2022., with enthusiastic support from the NRRWA members. What began as a humble effort has now blossomed into a meaningful annual celebration — one that beautifully blends devotion with creativity, and tradition with sustainability.

Conceived with a heartfelt mission, the workshop aims to revive the age-old tradition of handcrafting eco-friendly Ganesha idols, while also recognizing and supporting local artisans who keep this craft alive. Every year, participants across generations come together to mold their own clay Ganeshas — not just creating idols, but also nurturing memories and forging a deeper connection to our cultural roots.

Our Achievements So Far:
- Raised awareness about eco-friendly Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations
- Encouraged many families to switch to clay idols
- Offered a platform for local artisans to showcase and share their skills
- Fostered community bonding, creativity, and cultural continuity

## 2025 Workshop

This year too, more than 35 people created Ganesha clay idols under the guidance of Vaidehi and Rudraraju and Ranjitha. Photos from the event below.

## Looking Ahead

Our vision is to extend this initiative beyond our community and inspire neighboring societies to join the movement. With your continued encouragement and participation, we envision more hands shaping clay, more hearts united in celebration, and a stronger impact on both the environment and our traditions.

Let’s keep the tradition alive — one clay Ganesha at a time!
