In a step towards promoting sustainable living and responsible waste handling, a Home Composting Workshop was recently organized at the Namma Roopanagara Residents Welfare Association (NRRWA) Office in Roopanagar.

The event, conducted by NRRWA in association with [Dostbin Solutions Private Ltd.](https://dostbin.com/), aimed to empower residents to manage kitchen waste responsibly at home. Dostbin Solutions, an award-winning manufacturer of composting bins, educated participants on simple and effective composting techniques suitable for households.

Nearly 80 enthusiastic residents from Roopanagar and nearby layouts attended the workshop. The core team from Dostbin Solutions, led by **Shumail Ali Khan**, demonstrated their innovative composting bin and explained the complete composting process through an engaging and detailed presentation. Participants also got hands-on experience in using the bins, making the session both interactive and practical.

NRRWA President Narasimha Murthy presided over the programme. Director Raghu Srinivasan formally welcomed everyone, and Director Uma Peshwa smoothly compered the event.

Association Secretary K. S. Somayaji shared his hopes that the workshop would encourage more households to start composting their kitchen waste, thereby reducing dependency on garbage collectors and contributing to a cleaner neighbourhood.

Dr. Shushma Appaiah delivered the vote of thanks, appreciating the active participation of residents and the dedicated efforts of the Dostbin team.

The workshop concluded on a positive and inspiring note, equipping residents with practical knowledge, confidence, and simple techniques to adopt sustainable waste management practices at home.
