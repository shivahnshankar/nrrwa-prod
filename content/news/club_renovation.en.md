We are pleased to announce the successful installation of 25 new LED street lights in the Phase 2 area of Roopanagara, a significant milestone in our ongoing efforts to improve public infrastructure.

## Project Details

Through persistent follow-up with the Town Panchayat and collaborative efforts with the local Electricity Board, we have achieved this important upgrade for our community.

### Key Features
- **Energy Efficient**: New LED lights consume 50% less power
- **Better Illumination**: Improved visibility and safety
- **Maintenance**: 5-year warranty on all installations
- **Coverage**: Strategic placement covering all main roads in Phase 2

## Community Impact

The new street lights will significantly enhance:
- **Safety**: Better visibility for pedestrians and vehicles during night hours
- **Security**: Well-lit areas deter anti-social activities
- **Property Values**: Improved infrastructure enhances neighborhood appeal
- **Energy Savings**: LED technology reduces electricity costs

## Acknowledgments

We thank all NRRWA members who reported dark spots and helped identify locations needing better lighting. Special thanks to the Executive Committee members who coordinated with authorities to make this project a reality.

## Next Steps

NRRWA is now working on Phase 1 and Phase 3 areas. We expect to complete the entire project by March 2025.
