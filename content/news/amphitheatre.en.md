## A Proud Milestone: Amphitheater Inauguration Becomes a Cherished Community Moment

The inauguration of our community Amphitheater, organized by NRRWA, was a proud and memorable occasion marked by strong resident participation and distinguished guests. We were honored to welcome Hon’ble MP **Sri Yaduveer Krishnadatta Wadiyar** and Hon’ble MLA **Sri G.T. Devegowda**, whose presence added great significance to the event.

Both leaders appreciated the initiative to create a community-centric cultural space and highlighted the importance of such infrastructure in promoting social bonding, arts, education, and citizen engagement. They encouraged the community to actively use this space for cultural events, performances, workshops, and civic activities.

The event concluded with enthusiastic participation from residents, heartfelt appreciation for the organizers, and a shared vision of the Amphitheater becoming a vibrant hub for creativity, connection, and community pride.

As always, you can watch the entire event on YouTube thanks to Malati Bhat.
