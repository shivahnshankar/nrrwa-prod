Our community recently organized a Cardio Screening Camp in collaboration with Apollo BGS Hospital, Mysuru, focused on promoting heart health and wellness among residents.

The event offered comprehensive diagnostic screenings, including:

- Blood pressure monitoring
- Height and weight measurement
- Random blood sugar test
- ECG check

Residents also benefited from personal consultations with doctors, receiving valuable insights into maintaining a healthy heart and lifestyle.

Adding to the wellness theme, the Apollo physiotherapy team conducted an exclusive fitness session, guiding participants through practical routines for heart-friendly physical activity.

One of the camp’s most engaging highlights was the Fireless Cooking Competition, centered on dishes made with green leafy vegetables (soppu)—a fun and educational way to encourage heart-healthy eating. The contest featured two categories:

- Exclusively for men and boys
- Open to all age groups of residents

The event saw an excellent turnout, with a large number of residents enthusiastically participating and supporting the cause of heart health and community well-being.
