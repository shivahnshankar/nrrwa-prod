Even after spending many years in schools and colleges, students often do not develop the necessary skills to secure a job. Naturally, this leaves parents confused about how to best support their children. Today, many graduates complete their degrees but still struggle to find a job. While schools focus on marks, students frequently lack strong foundational skills.

To address these concerns, the NRRWA team organized a short talk for parents. The session “Preparing Children for the Future”, presented by **Mr. Kushal** and organized by NRRWA, was an insightful and engaging event focused on equipping children with the skills, mindset, and values needed to thrive in a rapidly changing world. 

Kushal shared practical strategies for developing confidence, emotional intelligence, critical thinking, and adaptability in children. The session received an enthusiastic response from parents and community members, who appreciated the meaningful guidance and interactive approach. The event successfully highlighted the importance of holistic development and the role of families and communities in shaping a brighter future for children.
