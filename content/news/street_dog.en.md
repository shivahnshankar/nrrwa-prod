As we all know, the number of stray dogs in Roopanagar is increasing steadily. And while most of the dogs are peaceful and form bonds with residents, if unchecked, their population would overwhelm the community. After a lot of discussion and debate, NRRWA decided to try and control the dog population in a humane and animal friendly manner through neutering and spaying.

NRRWA took up this task since a few months back. We identified 39 dogs for neutering/spaying. We are very happy to announce that Team in co- ordination with PFA could neuter/ spay 32 street dogs on date. 

Thanks to Residents who imposed faith in us and donated Rs. 47,500 for the purpose. We have paid Rs. 50,700 to PFA for neutering/ spaying and vaccination of 32 street dogs and obtained receipt.

We have done this exercise as one time measure. Now on, we request the residents who feed the street dogs to take the job forward. If any help needed, they can approach the team NRRWA.
